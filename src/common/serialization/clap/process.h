/**
 * A serializable wrapper around `clap_process_t`. This works exactly the same
 * as the process data wrapper for VST3. At the start of a process cycle all
 * audio data is copied to the already set up shared memory buffers and the
 * event and transport data is copied to this object. Then on the Wine side
 * we'll reconstruct the original `clap_process_t` and pass that to the plugin.
 * The output events are then sent back to the native plugin, where it can write
 * those along with the audio outputs (which are also in that shared memory
 * buffer) back to the host. The response is serialized in the
 * `clap::process::Process::Response` object since only a small amount of
 * information needs to be sent back.
 *
 * As mentioned earlier, the audio data is not stored in this object but it is
 * instead stored in a shared memory object shared by a `clap_plugin_proxy` and
 * `ClapPluginInstance` pair. Since the amount of audio data sent per processing
 * call is fixed, this halves the number of required memory copies.
 *
 * Be sure to double check how `clap::process::Process::Response` is used. We do
 * some pointer tricks there to avoid copies and moves when serializing the
 * results of our audio processing.

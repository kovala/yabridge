// These chainloader libraries are tiny, mostly dependencyless libraries that
// `dlopen()` the actual `libyabridge-{clap,vst2,vst3}.so` files and forward the
// entry point function calls from this library to those. Or technically, these
// libraries use dedicated entry point functions because multiple chainloader
// libraries may all dynamically link to the exact same plugin library, so we
// can't store any bridge information in a global there. This approach avoids
// wasting disk space on copies on file systems that don't support reflinking,
// but more importantly it also avoids the need to rerun `yabridgectl sync`
// whenever yabridge is updated. This is even more important when considering
// distro packaging, because updates to Boost might require the package to be
// rebuilt, which in turn would also require a resync.
